## Scaffolding
See the [Digital Dipole Wiki](https://github.com/347S24/347-final-project-digitaldipole/wiki/%E2%9A%9B%EF%B8%8F-Digital-Dipole) for scaffolding info and **setup steps**

## Task Board

It's not exactly time yet, but if you're excited I don't want to stand in the way. For (at least) the last 6 weeks of the semester, we'll organize your work into 2-week "Sprints" using a "task board". GitHub has a feature that the unfortunately call "projects" that we can use to plan and coordinate. There are many templates available, perhaps the "Featued" template titled "Iterative Developement" would be a good choice.

1. Find the "Projects" tab at the top of your repo in github
2. Click the arrow beside the green "Link Project" button and choose "New Project"
3. I guess now you also have to click "New Project" ðŸ™„
4. find the "iterative development" template and choose it.
